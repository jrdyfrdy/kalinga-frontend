## 🌟 Project Overview

Kalinga is a full-stack web application built to handle the complexities of emergency management. It features a robust role-based system catering to four distinct user types:

- **Patients:** For emergency SOS reporting, health record management, and appointment scheduling.
- **Responders:** For real-time incident navigation, secure communication, and on-scene assessment.
- **Logistics:** For hospital resource tracking, inventory management, and supply chain coordination.
- **Admins:** For overall system oversight, user management, and analytics.
